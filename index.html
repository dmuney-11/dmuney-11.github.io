      <p>Alright ladies and germs, it was another glorious week of fantasy football. As we enter the final third of the season, the top nine teams are separated by a single game. A few of the basement dwellers woke up from hibernation and delivered crushing blows to would-be playoff contenders.</p><p>This week‚Äôs rankings come paired with a bespoke, state-of-the-(generative)-art video clip, cooked up by yours truly. Because if there‚Äôs one thing this league was missing in our cold, meaningless void we call life, it‚Äôs more AI-generated slop. Enjoy.</p>

      <pre class="blurb">Your team is truly a sight to behold.  You could tell me that this team was drafted in 2020 and and I‚Äôd nod politely and ask how Keenan Allen‚Äôs retirement is going.  But if you told me a team whose best WR was a 52 year old Keenan Allen, with Danny Dimes leading the charge at QB would be contending for the #1 spot in 2025, I would have said, ‚ÄúJake?‚Äù - Close enough I guess.  But JT continues to carry this team to an extreme degree.  Somewhere above, Jim Irsay‚Äôs throwing the kind of party heaven probably didn‚Äôt approve. Nose beers, a harem of angels and a drink in hand, watching JT carve defenses. I‚Äôm happy for him, I really am. But still‚Ä¶ Arrest Irsay, forever.</pre>

      <pre class="blurb">In an era where the bellcow RB is going the way of the dodo, you have incredibly managed to land at least 3.5, if not 4 of them - assuming you count D‚Äôandre ‚Äúwe bring in DJ moore for short yardage‚Äù Swift.  You‚Äôve faced adversity the way Swift faces a designed run between the tackles, with a hard cut to the outside and, somehow, spectacular results.



Lamar Jackson injury? No worries, Ahuasca Aaron has got this.  Tyreek dead? The generational plodders Sutton and Pittman will fill the void.  It‚Äôs truly sensational stuff, and it's earned you copious amounts of homework and an almost free-roll to a shot at a back-to-back ship this season.  Truly inspirational stuff.</pre>

      <pre class="blurb">This is the ideal fantasy team.  You may not like it, but this is what peak robust RB drafting looks like.  Two absolutely ELITE, GENERATIONAL running back talents, and I am up to my eyeballs in WR2s. Crashee Rice has come careening off of his suspension and I look forward to mowing down all who dare to swerve into my lane.  It's all gas, no brakes, straight to the finish line. Buckle up buckaroos.</pre>

      <pre class="blurb">You know Cody, your team is actually legit pretty good this year.  And I know, that you know, that this pains me physically to put in writing.  You executed the 0 RB strat pretty flawlessly, with a WR core that has me drooling like I‚Äôm five nooners deep into my 3rd FBI challenge.  Also, our league has collectively allowed you to amass a bench full of high value hand-cuffs, one injury away from creating an unstoppable juggernaut.  I am saying all of this as your friend, so that you know what I am about to say is true - It's time bro.  Just rip the bandaid and send Nick Chubb off to the big blue tent in the sky.</pre>

      <pre class="blurb">In spite of the walloping that was just delivered to you courtesy of yours truly, there are some real bright spots on this roster.  Arguably the best WR room in the league, all while Nico has been doing his best Calvin Ridley impersonation. On the other hand, when it comes to your RBs, your absolute commitment to the bit is extremely commendable.  My main critique is that I think ‚Äúdusted‚Äù may be too favorable an adjective here as it implies that they were at one point not dusty.  Oh, and has anyone told you that you wrote the best power rankings of the year?</pre>

      <pre class="blurb">This ranking comes with a breaking news story brought to you by a fearless anonymous whistleblower, who received the following texts from Mikey on Sunday morning, minutes before lock:







You are reading that right folks.  Your co-commissioner wants to BAN people for properly setting their lineup.  Now before you all rush to judgement, let us practice empathy.  Who among us, when faced with the likes of Xavier Hutchinsen, Demario Douglas and Evan Engram in the flex, wouldn‚Äôt consider some form of sabotage to prevent an embarrassing loss.  



I hope we can all grow, and learn from this, and emerge stronger as a league as a result.  We are committed to transparency in this league and will ensure that governance remains fair and balanced.

      <pre class="blurb">Sean, as a tight-end enjoyer, I am sure you can agree, it was an absolutely ELECTRIC national tight-ends week.  Kicked off by the best TE in the league absolutely smashing on TNF.  That‚Äôs right, Orande Gadsen babyyyyy.  I am sure it had to hurt compiling exactly 0 TE points on this sacred day, so I won‚Äôt belabor the point too much.  We are all keeping you in our thoughts and prayers, and hope that you will soon be able to start a TE in the flex like you have always wanted.</pre>

      <pre class="blurb">What can we really say about this squad that hasn‚Äôt already been said. You doubted the Samoan Slammer and started Bengals D and it cost you the win.  You should definitely fire the person who gave you that advice.  On the bright side, Olave is absolutely cooking and he‚Äôs got a 26 year old rookie QB who can start shuckin him some balls.</pre>

You have an extremely boom-bust roster, and although your team has been busting more than Johnny Sins this year, I think you have a real shot at making a run if all the pieces fall into place.</pre>

My god, there's a lot of whites on this team. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Holy fuck, this retard is STARTING THREE TEs this week.  Not sure if you were just baiting me into this one, but you know the rules.</pre>
